# FIND THE ERROR
1. there shouldnt be a semicolon at the end of the if statements
   there needs to be braces

2. it should be == instead of =

3. there should be braces for between all the statements of the if and the else

4. the case statement matches the variable to a value, not a condition

5. "x > 20" should be in parethese. also use <=

6. all numbers are accepted by this condition, it should be &&

7. no number are accepted by this condition, it should be ||

8. the ? and : are reversed

9. the String.equals method is case-sensitive

10. should be "%.2f"

1. ```
switch (choice) {
	case 1:
		System.out.println("You selected 1.");
		break;
	case 2:
	case 3:
		System.out.println("You selected 2 or 3.");
		break;
	case 4:
		System.out.println("You selected 4.");
		break;
	default:
		System.out.println("Select again please.");
}
```

2. ```
if (title1.compareTo(title2) < 0) {
	System.out.println(title1);
	System.out.println(title2);
} else {
	System.out.println(title2);
	System.out.println(title1);
}
