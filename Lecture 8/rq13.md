# TRUE OR FALSE
(a) ~~ ~~
    False. Autoboxing occurs when adding a primitive type to a collection, which means the primitive type is converted to its corresponding type-wrapper class.
(b) ~~True~~
    False 
(c) False
(d) True
(e) ~~ ~~
    False. Collections is a class; Collection is an interface
(f) True
(g) ~~True~~
    False. As the load factor increases, fewer slots are available relative to the total number of slots, so the chance of a collision increases.
(h) False. Attempting to insert a null element causes a NullPointerException.
